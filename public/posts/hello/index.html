    </header><p>An immersive experience where participants remotely control humanoid robots in a high-energy, XR-enhanced arena. RoboRumble blends strategy, skill, and engineering in an interactive environment that feels like a live sports event—reimagined with technology.</p>
<p>Concept Highlights:</p>
<ol>
<li>Humanoid Robot Design and Customization</li>
</ol>
<p>Participants use modular humanoid robots that can be customized with a range of “abilities” like agility, speed, or defensive features. This lets players craft unique personalities and approaches for their robots.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>XR-Enhanced Tele-Steering</li>
</ol>
<p>Through VR headsets, controllers, and haptic feedback, participants experience the sensation of being “inside” their robots. This first-person view offers real-time visuals and stats for total situational awareness, making every move feel immersive and engaging.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Dynamic Arena with Real-Time Interaction</li>
</ol>
<p>The XR arena adds layers of strategy, with obstacles, virtual barriers, and safe “challenge zones” that create an evolving environment. Real-world elements, like moving platforms or soft impact zones, blend with digital overlays to add depth without danger.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Skill-Based Scoring System</li>
</ol>
<p>Matches are won by points, rewarding finesse, strategy, and well-timed moves rather than simple takedowns. Points are awarded for achievements like tagging, maneuvering through obstacles, or completing objectives, focusing on skill and creativity.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Community and Spectator Engagement</li>
</ol>
<p>Fans and spectators join the experience through AR/XR, seeing the competition up-close with stats, replays, and even interactive “cheering” features. A global leaderboard and community-driven challenges bring people together for continuous engagement and friendly competition.</p>
